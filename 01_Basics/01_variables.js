// ways of creating variables in javascript
const account_id = 12345
let accountEmail= "abc@gmail.com"
var pass="123456"
//account_id = 2 //not allowed
console.log(account_id) 
accountEmail = "hc@gmail.com"
pass = "5432"
console.table([account_id,accountEmail,pass])

/*prefer not to var keyword declaring variables in javascript 
because of issue in block scope and functional scope*/
